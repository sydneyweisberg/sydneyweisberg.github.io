            <h2>About</h2>
            <body>
                <p>I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Statistical Data Science at Smith College. I am passionate about solving problems through technology using collaborative and sustainable approaches. Over the course of my studies, I've honed my skills in programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, C, HTML, CSS, x86, etc., and developed a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering.</p>
                <p>I’m particularly interested in software engineering, where I can combine my technical skills with problem-solving to build scalable, efficient software solutions. I’m also passionate about game development and enjoy creating immersive, interactive experiences.</p>
                <p>Outside of the classroom, I’m actively seeking opportunities to grow through internships, conferences, and collaborative projects. I’m excited to contribute to the tech industry and learn from new experiences!</p>
